Doing some leisure reading today and saw a graph on income inequality. It presented a heatmap that visualized darker regions for more inequality and lighter regions for less, where inequality was defined as the prominance of large disparities in incomes. I thought this was an interesting way to present inequality that I have not seen before, but not sure how they determined which regions to group together, since the regions were larger than cities.
