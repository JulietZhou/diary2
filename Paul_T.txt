What percentage of people who go to a restaurant or stay at a hotel or purchase a product online end up reviewing it? It is generally thought that those who write reviews tend to have more extreme (positive or negative) opinions. Are there ways to incentivize more people to leave reviews and also minimize potential bias of future reviews?
