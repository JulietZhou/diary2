Found a candidate for worst visualization ever: (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/03/the-confused-persons-guide-to-middle-east-conflicts/388883/?utm_source=SFFB). In case you don’t click the link, it’s a chart of all the relationships between major players in the Middle East, a mess of interacting lines. It’s clearly not meant to be taken seriously, but I think it takes a subject that people could understand with some effort and instead make it seem unknowable. Rather than try and explain a complicated situation, the creators are perpetuating ignorance by obfuscating the reality.
